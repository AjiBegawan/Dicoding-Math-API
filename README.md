# Math API
A project implementing Test Driven Development (TDD) principles to build a robust and reliable Math API. This approach ensures code functionality and minimizes incompatibilities, boosting confidence in delivery.

## Test Driven Development (TDD) Flows
This project showcases the TDD workflow to create a secure and efficient Math API:

- Define Test Cases: Begin by outlining clear and comprehensive test cases for the desired functionalities.
- Fail First: Run the tests initially, expecting and observing failures as a starting point.
- Write Minimal Code: Implement only the minimum code necessary to make the tests pass successfully.
- Green Light: Re-run the tests, aiming for flawless passing results.
- Refactor with Confidence: Refine the code while ensuring all tests remain green, maintaining stability.
- Iterate and Improve: Repeat the cycle of writing tests, writing code, and refactoring to continuously enhance the API.
